## 📖 Overview

**Vietnamese_ASR** is an end-to-end **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** project designed to **optimize speech-to-text accuracy across Vietnamese dialects**.
The project focuses on fine-tuning large-scale pretrained models (e.g., **PhoWhisper**, **Wav2Vec2**, **Conformer**) using a **dialect-balanced corpus (ViMD)** covering **63 provinces across 3 major dialect regions** — Northern, Central, and Southern Vietnam.

This research-driven system aims to address the **acoustic and lexical variability** of regional Vietnamese, improving performance for underrepresented accents.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🔈 **Dialect-Aware Fine-Tuning** — Adapted from Whisper multilingual backbone using the ViMD dataset
* 🧹 **Robust Preprocessing Pipeline** — Noise trimming, silence removal, normalization, and filtering
* 🧠 **Transformer-Based Architecture** — Leverages PhoWhisper / Wav2Vec2-CTC frameworks
* 📊 **Comprehensive Evaluation** — Metrics include WER (Word Error Rate) and CER (Character Error Rate)
* 🌏 **Regional Accent Adaptation** — Balanced training data across 63 provinces
* ⚙️ **Server-Ready Scripts** — Preconfigured for training on **Vast.ai** or local GPU setups

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Dataset Preparation (ViMD)**

   * 102.5 hours of Vietnamese speech
   * Collected from 63 provinces across 3 dialects
   * Balanced by region and gender

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Audio normalization (16 kHz)
   * Silence trimming (`librosa.effects.trim`)
   * Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal)

3. **Model Fine-Tuning**

   * Base model: **PhoWhisper (from Whisper-Small)**
   * Framework: **Hugging Face Transformers + PyTorch**
   * Optimizer: AdamW
   * Learning rate: 1e-5
   * Scheduler: Linear decay

4. **Evaluation Metrics**

   * **Word Error Rate (WER)**
   * **Character Error Rate (CER)**

## 📈 Results Summary

| Model                       | Dataset | WER ↓     | CER ↓     | Notes                         |
| --------------------------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Whisper Multilingual (base) | ViMD    | 22.4%     | 18.7%     | Baseline                      |
| **PhoWhisper (fine-tuned)** | ViMD    | **16.8%** | **13.2%** | Improved dialectal robustness |

> Fine-tuning improved recognition performance by over **25% relative reduction in WER**, especially on Central and Southern dialects.
